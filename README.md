###### **NOTE**: This was started as a project mid-2015. Since then, I have not had the time to devote to building it into what it should be. The domain is purchased through 2025, but hosting may need to change if it doesn't become self-sufficient in time. Proposed roadmap to follow.


# Visualization of top 100 companies hiring veterans

## Information for veterans and the companies themselves to see where they stack up.

This is a tool to graphically show who are the top 100 companies hiring veterans as reported to the Department of Labor in filing cycle 2014 or higher.

### Problem
This is to show which companies are actually hiring which should help veterans wade through the stacks of employers.
